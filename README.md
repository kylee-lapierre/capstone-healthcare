# Capstone Healthcare


### Objective
Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers a portion of the cost of medical expenses. There is a portion of the population that is uninsured in the United States; understanding the factors behind lacking health insurance or sufficient access to healthcare could illuminate the way to improve health insurance coverage in the country. For the purpose of this work, those with *sufficient access to healthcare* include people who do not delay or avoid seeking healthcare services due to cost. *Uninsured* includes those who do not have health insurance.

We are interested in understanding the factors that lead to a lack of health insurance and lacking health insurance or sufficient access to healthcare nationwide and in the counties in Minnesota in 2019. We are looking into race and ethnicity, gender, age, income, immigration status, educational attainment, and location to see how these play a role in someoneâ€™s insurance status. 




### Exploratory Questions
  * How do rates of uninsured vary among various demographics (race, age, sex, population, income, educational attainment level)
  * How does access to health care vary (by county)?
  * Do rates of uninsurance vary based on offered plan types? 
  * Does the percent/population of uninsured/insured individuals change where access to care is less available?
  * Can we predict which areas will have more/less coverage based on demographics, income, or other factors?
  * For people who are covered, is it sufficient coverage?
