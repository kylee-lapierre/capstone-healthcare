# Capstone Healthcare


### Objective
Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers a portion of the cost of medical expenses. There is a portion of the population that is uninsured in the United States; understanding the factors behind lacking health insurance or sufficient access to healthcare could illuminate the way to improve health insurance coverage in the country. For the purpose of this work, those with *sufficient access to healthcare* include people who do not delay or avoid seeking healthcare services due to cost. *Uninsured* includes those who do not have health insurance.

We are interested in understanding the factors that lead to a lack of health insurance and lacking health insurance or sufficient access to healthcare nationwide and in the counties in Minnesota in 2019. We are looking into race and ethnicity, gender, age, income, immigration status, educational attainment, and location to see how these play a role in someoneâ€™s insurance status. 




### Exploratory Questions
  * How do unisurance rates vary among various demographics such as race, age, sex, population, income, educational attainment level?
  * How does access to health care vary at a national level and by county?
  * How does access to health care vary among Minnesota counties?
  * Does the rate of uninsurance vary for individuals based on the number of hospitals in their county?
  * Can we predict which areas will have more or less coverage based on demographics, income, hospital count or other factors?
  * For those who are covered, is their coverage sufficient for their health needs?
