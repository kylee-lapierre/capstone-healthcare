## Capstone Healthcare


# Objective
Identify areas of growth for Minnesota re: uninsured populations
Research demographics for areas with high rates of uninsured people


# Exploratory Questions
  * How do rates of uninsured vary among various demographics (race, age, sex, population, income, educational attainment level)
  * How does access to health care vary (by county?)
  * Do rates of uninsurance vary based on offered plan types? 
  * Does the percent/population of uninsured/insured individuals change where access to care is less available (for 2021 by using population data)?
  * Can we predict which areas will have more/less coverage based on demographics, income, or other factors?



# Initial datasets:
  * Census SAHIE 
  * BRFSS: Healthcare Access/Coverage
  * Healthcare estimates by demographics & population (Census)
